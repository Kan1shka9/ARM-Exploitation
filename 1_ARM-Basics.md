#### 1. ARM Basics

- ``ARM`` - Advanced RISC Machine

- ``RISC`` - Reduced Instruction Set Computer

--

- General Purpose Registers
	- 13
	- ``R0`` to ``R12``

- Special Purpose Registers
	- ``R13``
		- Stack pointer
	- ``R14``
		- Link register
		- Stores the address at which execution should continue after a function returns.
	- ``R15``
		- Program Counter
		- Used to store the address in memory of the next instruction to be executed.
		- It is automatically incremented after an instruction is executed so that it can point to the next instruction.

- Instructions used to call a function

``BL 0xabcd``

``BL`` - Branch with Link

``BL`` instruction takes the current value stored inside the ``PC`` register and stores it inside the ``R14``/``Link register``. Execution is then redirected to the new function. At the end of the function the value of the ``R14``/``Link register`` is removed from the stack and used to resume execution at that address by moving it into the ``PC`` register

- Modifying ``PC``

	- PC can be directly modifies in an ARM assembly program.
	- For instance while calling a sub-routine a programmer can move an address of his choice into the PC

- ARM Operating Modes

	- ``16 bit mode`` - Thumb mode
	- ``32 bit mode``

Prevent thumb mode from being used ``-mno-thumb``
